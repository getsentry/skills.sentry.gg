  // This proxy serves the *un-built* sources straight from GitHub, so that copy
  // never happened — `skills/<skill>/references/<x>` usually doesn't exist. To
  // make those same relative links resolve over HTTP, a request for
  // `/<skill>/references/<rest>` that misses in the skill is retried against the
  // shared library at `${BASE}/references/<rest>` (repo root, no `skills/`
  // prefix). Because the rewrite only swaps that prefix, links inside the shared
  // docs (which are relative to the library root) keep resolving under the same
  // `/<skill>/references/…` namespace and hit this same fallback.

  // first and only fall back to the shared library.
